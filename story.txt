# A Day at Schloss Eltz

It was a crisp morning when Anna and Melhase decided ton visit Schloss Eltz, a beautiful castle in Germany. On there way, they met a Kugelrund man eating Apfelkuchen.
The man offered them a bite, and as they politely declined, he exclaimed, “You must try the Bratwurst at the Biergarten instead it’s legendary!”. Melhase again politely declined saying "I prefer the Baeckerei!" and began walking quickly.
Finally they reached the hauptstrasse and could see the castle in sight, when suddenly a BMW pulled up on their shoulder without its blinker. 
A woman came out of the car, wearing a dirndel and lederhose, walked over to Anna and Melhase, and told them: 
If you're heading to Schloss Eltz, you might want to stop by the Ratskeller first for some refreshments—it’s right next to the Flughafen, and the view is unbeatable!' Anna and Melhase exchanged glances before the woman added, 'Plus, the Klimaanlage in there is a welcome relief after a long walk like yours.
With the thought of cool air and a tasty Apfelkuchen from the Ratskeller, Anna and Melhase decided to take the woman's advice and headed straight for the Flughafen, eager for a refreshing break.
But on the way, they were distracted by the sounds of Rammstein's music coming from a house down the street, and decided to investigate. 
As Anna and Melhase continued down the road, getting closer to the house, they noticed a couple of wettbewerbsfaehig guys playing a game of cards.
As they were getting closer and closer to the house they began to smell Brot in the air, and began to feel a little hungry. The Hund jumped into my Volkswagen just before the rain started pouring on Hauptstrasse.
